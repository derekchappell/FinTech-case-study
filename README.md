 - Additionally they offer a checking account, however the investing is the more eye catching service they currently offer.
 - The intended customer is the retail investor, which would account for roughly half the U.S. population, that percentage shrinking when taking into consideration multiple factors.
 -  The primary one seems to be associated with the celebrities they have as investors bringing in huge amounts of users. The primary appeal however is the hands off approach to investing that they take and ultimately the algorithmic based investing plan of action they have decided on.
 -  The company utilizes a lot of what appear to be common tools to the field including, Ruby,  google Analytics, JavaScript etc. [Here is a list](https://stackshare.io/acorns/acorns)

## Landscape ##

 - The company was operating in the deposit account market almost exclusively and has gained huge traction in a pivot to consumer investing based on the same principle of their savings account that they had launched with.
 - The largest trend and one we have discussed during this course is mobile technology being utilized in the banking arena for its ease of use and availability to the common consumer.
 - Acorns currently was the pioneer of the 'round up, micro investing' savings technique that has been utilized by not only direct startup competition but larger institutions as well. Keeping things in the realm of startups we can see they are currently edging out all their competition.

## Results ## 

 - As of this review 7 million user have put to the test the services acorn uses to aid consumer investors, this momentum has lead to multiple copy cat startups as well as institutional investment firms attempting to get in on the action of micro investing as well.

 - Since they operate as an investment firm for the most part now, user base will be the key criteria looked at here from largest to smallest. AUM would be considered however the information regarding exact figures is not readily available for all players in this field

| Company     | User Base             |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Robinhood   | 10,000,000         |
| Sofi        | 7,500,000 		  |
| Acorns      | 7,000,000+ 		 |
| Stash       | 4,000,000 	  	  |
| Betterment  | 500,000  		  |
| Wealth Front | 21,450   		  |

As we can see above Acorns is among the larger groups in this arena currently.

## Recommendations ##

Given the huge success of Robinhood it is apparent there is a desire in the market for retail investors to have quick, easy, understandable access to the stock market and the ability to trade. Since Acorns started off life as a savings device more than anything else it would make sense for the average user to only be able to utilize a portion of their funds in Acorns, say 20% to put towards stock picking. The average retail investor is essentially betting when they decide to pick stocks or at an even high risk rate futures and options. Acorns keeping the reigns tight to dissuade this sort of behavior and having 80% of users portfolio tied to an index fund would still act in many ways as a savings device while still being far more interesting and engaging than watching a savings balance increase. 

**Benefits would include:**

- A more engaging entertaining application
- Increased user base as evidenced by the huge growth Robinhood has seen
- Accomplishing the initial goal of forcing users to save

The technology needed to implement this change would include the ability for real time updates to market share price and accurately displaying these values at all times with no interruptions. furthermore the various investing tools available need to be implemented regarding trading vehicles such as options. All of this needs to be seamlessly accessible on a users phone. 

**Technologies**

- Smart phones capabilities
- Real time stock value tracking
- Simple to understand UI

These technologies need to be robust, these ability to have constant access with accurate values in an easy to understand layout are paramount to user uptake. Without keen focus on these areas users may be initially interested but that will quickly wane if it is too complicated or worse causes them to lose money.

**Acorns is on the right track with the celebrity backing to boot, the ground work for expansion into a new domain has been laid all they need to do is walk the walk.**
